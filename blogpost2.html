            <p>Having nursing mothers around me, often heard of 6-months exclusive breastfeeding. This  literally means that the baby takes nothing but breastmilk for the duration of 6 months. And this is the least you can breastfeed a child for.</p>
            <p>There is another one, (would like to tag it inclusive breastfeeding), the mother breastfeeds her baby for a year or more but gives the baby other nutritional elements outside breastmilk. You choose what suits you!.</p>
            <p>Breastmilk has the best nutritional combination necessary for the normal growth and development of a child, the protein, carbohydrate, calcium, antibodies and antibiotics. The protein composition of human breast milk is essential for the infants growth, as these numerous proteins are easily digested than the ones in cow milk, and they help in protection against infection, allergies, eczema, inflammation, infections, cold etc.</p>
            <p>Carbohydrate in the human breast milk appears in its simple form (lactose), which helps to reduce quite a number of unfriendly bacteria present in the stomach.</p>
            <p>Psychological studies revealed that there is a direct physical proximity between the mother and the child during breastfeeding. Of course, there is eye contact each time the child sucks the mothers breast, this in turn creates and secure some kind of bond between mother and child.</p>
            <p>Breastfed infants usually gain the necessary the quantity of weight needed unlike children who are not breastfed (formula-fed infants). Formula-fed infants are mostly overweight children.</p>
            <p>The function of the immune system is to identify and fight against unfamiliar cells on their entry into the body system. The absence of an immune system or the presence of an under-developed one can lead to various diseases taking control of the body system.</p>
            <p>Babies do not have strong immune system until 2-3 months after birth. So, what happens within that duration?</p>
            <p>Only the mother has fully developed antibodies and can be passed to the baby only through BREASTFEEDING!. The breastmilk contains elements that aids the immune system which helps in fighting against intruders.</p>
